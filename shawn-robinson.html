<h1>Shawn Robinson</h1>
            
            Dawn Sherrese Robinson (born November 24, 1966) is an American singer and actress best known as a founding member of the R&amp;B/pop group En Vogue, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Following her departure from En Vogue, Robinson joined Lucy Pearl and released their self-titled debut album Lucy Pearl in 2000, which went platinum worldwide and produced the successful singles "Dance Tonight" and "Don't Mess with My Man".<br/><br/>In 2002, Robinson released her first solo album Dawn, which produced the single "Envious". In 2005, Robinson rejoined En Vogue for a tour, but departed from the group before they could record another album. In 2009, Robinson briefly returned to En Vogue again for their 20th Anniversary Tour. In late 2011, she left En Vogue once again due to poor management and compensation of work. In 2013, she joined the cast of R&amp;B Divas: Los Angeles for the first season of the series.<br/><br/>Over her career, Robinson has sold a combined total of over 11 million records as a member of En Vogue, Lucy Pearl and a solo artist. Her work with En Vogue has earned her several awards and nominations, including two American Music Awards, a Billboard Music Award, seven MTV Video Music Awards, four Soul Train Music Awards and eight Grammy nominations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Born on November 24, 1966 (some sources cite her birth year as 1968) in New London, Connecticut, Robinson was the oldest of three children born to John W. Robinson (1943–2014) and Barbara Alexander.
