            The Jungle Book is a 2016 American fantasy adventure film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, written by Justin Marks and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a live-action/photorealistically animated remake of Disney's 1967 animated film The Jungle Book, which itself is loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's story collection The Jungle Book. Neel Sethi plays Mowgli, the orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. The film includes voice and motion capture performances from Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito, and Christopher Walken.<br/><br/>Favreau, Marks, and producer Brigham Taylor developed the film's story as a balance between Disney's animated feature film adaptation and Rudyard Kipling's original works, borrowing elements from both into the film. Principal photography commenced in 2014, with filming taking place entirely in Los Angeles. The film required extensive use of computer-generated imagery to portray the other animals and settings.<br/><br/>The Jungle Book premiered at El Capitan Theatre on April 4, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 15. The film was a critical and commercial success, with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus describes it "as lovely to behold as it is engrossing to watch", and grossed $966 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2016. Amongst Disney's live-action remakes, the film is the eighth-most-expensive and fifth-highest-grossing readaptation to date.
