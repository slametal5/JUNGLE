            The Jungle Nation, also known as the Jungle Republic, was an unrecognised state, that existed between 1899 and 1900, in the modern territory of Peru, within the departments of Loreto, San Martín, and Ucayali. It was proclaimed on 22 May 1899, by colonel Emilio Vizcarra, who then acquired the title of the Supreme Leader. The state was formed from the territory of Department of Loreto, Peru. It was reincorporated into Peru in 1900, shortly after the death of Vizcarra on 27 February 1900.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1896, colonels Eduardo Jessup and Emilio Vizcarra led the land campaign from Cajamarca to intervene in the Loretan Insurrection, fighting against the forces of self-proclaimed Federal State of Loreto. The rebellion was defeated on 10 July 1896, with Federal State being reincorporated into Peru. Following that, Vizcarra was appointed by the Peruvian government, as the prefect of the re-established Department of Loreto. The regional Loretan identity and social chaos were still present among the public, and Vizcarra eventually, started sharing the pro-regional views.<br/><br/>On 22 May 1899, Vizcarra had announced the independence of the Department of Loreto as a sovereign state, called Jungle Nation. He also titled himself the Supreme Leader of said country.
