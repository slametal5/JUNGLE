            Psychedelic Jungle is the second album by the American rock band the Cramps. It was released in May 1981 on I.R.S. Records. It was engineered by Paul McKenna and recorded in January 1981 at A&amp;M Studios. It was self-produced by the Cramps. The photo on the back cover of the album was taken by the noted photographer and director Anton Corbijn.<br/><br/>Only half of the album's 14 tracks are original compositions, written by guitarist Poison Ivy Rorschach and singer Lux Interior. The rest are cover versions of rock and roll, rockabilly, and garage rock singles from the 1950s and 1960s; these include "Green Door" by Jim Lowe (1956), "Jungle Hop" by Kip Tyler and the Flips (1958), "Rockin' Bones" by Ronnie Dawson (1959), "Goo Goo Muck" by Ronnie Cook and the Gaylads (1962), "The Crusher" by the Novas (1964), "Primitive" by the Groupies (1966), and "Green Fuz" by Green Fuz (1969).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Track listing ==<br/><br/>Writing credits adapted from the album's liner notes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Personnel ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== The Cramps ===<br/><br/>Lux Interior – vocals<br/><br/>Poison Ivy Rorschach – guitar<br/><br/>Kid Congo Powers – guitar<br/><br/>Nick Knox – drums<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Technical ===<br/><br/>Paul McKenna – engineer<br/><br/>Donna Santisi – front cover photography<br/><br/>Anton Corbijn – back cover photography<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== In popular culture ==<br/><br/>The song "Goo Goo Muck" plays during the original dance scene in the television series Wednesday, which led to a resurgence of the song.
