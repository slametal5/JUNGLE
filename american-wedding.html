            American Wedding (known as American Pie 3: The Wedding or American Pie: The Wedding, in some countries) is a 2003 American sex comedy film written by Adam Herz and directed by Jesse Dylan. It is the sequel to American Pie (1999) and American Pie 2 (2001), and the third of the American Pie franchise.<br/><br/>The film's main plot focuses on the wedding ceremony of Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), while its subplot centers on Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), and his outrageous antics including his attempt to organize a bachelor party, teaching Jim to dance for the wedding, and competing with Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) to win the heart of Michelle's sister, Cadence (January Jones). It is the last film in the series to be written by Herz, who conceptualized the franchise, and also the only theatrical film in the series in which Chris Klein (Oz), Chris Owen (Sherman), Mena Suvari (Heather), Tara Reid (Vicky), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia) and Natasha Lyonne (Jessica) do not appear.<br/><br/>Released on August 1, 2003, American Wedding is the lowest-grossing installment in the theatrical American Pie film series, although it was still a box office success, grossing $232.7 million worldwide on a $55 million budget. Like the previous two films, American Wedding received mixed reviews from critics, who were again divided on its humor but praised the cast's performances, especially Scott's.<br/><br/>The franchise was later expanded into a series of direct-to-DVD standalone spin-offs, under the umbrella title American Pie Presents, that began with the release of Band Camp (2005). A direct sequel to Wedding, titled American Reunion, was released in 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In a restaurant in East Great Falls, Michigan, Jim Levenstein hints to his girlfriend Michelle that he is about to propose, until his dad calls to inform him he left the ring at home. She misinterprets his hints and performs fellatio on him under the table, as his dad arrives with the ring so they are publicly exposed.
