            "Bungle in the Jungle" is a song by British progressive rock band Jethro Tull. It was released on their album War Child in 1974.<br/><br/>A remnant from the band's abandoned "Chateau D'Isaster Tapes", "Bungle in the Jungle" features lyrics based on analogies between animals and humans. The song was later released as a single, becoming a top 20 hit in the United States and top 5 in Canada.<br/><br/>Despite the song's American success, Anderson saw the song as too commercial and a minor song in the band's catalogue outside of North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Following the success of the band's 1972 album Thick as a Brick, Jethro Tull spent time in Paris to record the unfinished "Chateau D'isaster Tapes". According to Jethro Tull bandleader Ian Anderson, the unfinished album was intended to focus on "exploring people, the human condition, through analogies with the animal kingdom." Though a finished version was never released, some of the songs originally intended for the project appeared on the albums A Passion Play and War Child; Anderson later said, "That particular song was perhaps the more obvious and the more catchy of the tunes [from the sessions]."<br/><br/>Unlike other songs in the band's catalogue, "Bungle in the Jungle" features a more traditional, rock-oriented arrangement and structure. Anderson would later comment on this discrepancy in style:<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's a rather odd song for Jethro Tull, I think. Every so often there are those songs that fall into the conventional pop rock structure—songs like "Teacher", for instance—but that style isn't our forte. We're not very good at it because I'm not that kind of a singer, and it doesn't come easy to me to do that stuff.
