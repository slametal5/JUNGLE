The album additionally marks the first time that Jungle have included featured collaborations on a release, with American rapper Bas and Swiss-Tamil musician Priya Ragu, respectively.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Composition ==<br/><br/>The album as a whole discusses themes of "new beginnings, new love and fighting back against the odds". In an interview discussing the album, frontman Josh Lloyd-Watson stated:"When we write music there's hope. Maybe today we'll create something that influences people and changes the way they feel. If you can make something that lifts people, that's an amazing feeling."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Release ==<br/><br/>On 16 March 2021, Jungle premiered a trailer titled Loving in Stereo featuring a vignette of the dancers regularly associated with the collective from previous videos, performing in an abandoned compound or prison.
