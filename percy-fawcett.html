            Percy Harrison Fawcett  (18 August 1867 – disappeared 29 May 1925) was a British geographer, artillery officer, cartographer, archaeologist and explorer of South America. He disappeared in 1925 (along with his eldest son, Jack, and one of Jack's friends, Raleigh Rimmel) during an expedition to find an ancient lost city which he and others believed existed in the Amazon rainforest.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Percy Fawcett was born on 18 August 1867 in Torquay, Devon, to Edward Boyd Fawcett and Myra Elizabeth (née MacDougall). The Fawcetts were a family of old Yorkshire gentry (Fawcett of Scaleby Castle) who had prospered as shipping magnates in the East Indies during the late 18th and 19th centuries. Fawcett's father had been born in India, and was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), while his elder brother, Edward Douglas Fawcett, was a mountain climber, Eastern occultist and the author of philosophical books and popular adventure novels.<br/><br/>During the 1880s, Percy Fawcett was schooled at Newton Abbot Proprietary College, alongside Bertram Fletcher Robinson, the future sportsman, journalist, writer and mutual friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Thereafter, he attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned as a lieutenant of the Royal Artillery on 24 July 1886. That same year, Fawcett met his future wife, Nina Agnes Paterson, whom he married in 1901 and had two sons, Jack (1903–1925?) and Brian (1906–1984), and one daughter, Joan (1910–2005). On 13 January 1896, Fawcett was appointed Adjutant of the 1st Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Artillery Volunteers, and was promoted to captain on 15 June 1897. He later served in Hong Kong, Malta and Trincomalee, Ceylon.
