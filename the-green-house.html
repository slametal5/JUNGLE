            The Green House (Original title: La Casa Verde) is  the second novel by the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa,  published in 1966. The novel is set over a period of forty years (from the early part of the 20th century to the 1960s) in two regions of Peru: Piura, a dusty town near the coast in the north, and Peruvian Amazonia, specifically the jungle region near the Marañón river.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>The novel was inspired by memories of the author's youth in Piura and a journey through the jungle he made in 1958. Vargas Llosa has described the novel as "a fusion of very different experiences" that had impressed him.<br/><br/>The oldest of the stories that compose the book dates back to Piura: ″It's a story of a brothel in Piura, which I remember vividly from when I was in fifth grade of grammar school. It was a green house – or cabin – in the middle of the dunes, on the outskirts of the city, right in the desert, across the river. For us children there was something fascinating about it. Of course I never dared go anywhere near it. Still it left quite an impression on me.″ Six years later Vargas Llosa visited the place and found out that "it had a very strange atmosphere″; ″It was nothing but a single huge room, where the women were, and where there was a three-man combo made up of an old blind man, playing the harp, a guitarist known as ′el Joven′ (The Young One), and a lumbering giant who looked like a catch-wrestler or a truckdriver, who played the drums and cymbals and was known as Bolas (Balls). Because they're almost mythical characters to me, I've kept their names intact in the book.
