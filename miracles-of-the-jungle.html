            Miracles of the Jungle is a 1921 American adventure film serial, directed by James Conway and E. A. Martin, in 15 chapters, starring Ben Hagerty, Wilbur Higby, and Al Ferguson. A co-production by Selig Studios and Warner Bros., it was distributed by the Federated Film Exchanges of America; it originally ran in U.S. theaters between May 24 and August 24, 1921.<br/><br/>This film serial is considered lost.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cast ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>Through the success of the serial The Lost City, previously made by Selig and Warner, the co-production of Selig Polyscope Company and Warner Bros., Miracles of the Jungle, began. Emma Bell Clifton wrote the original screenplay, which was adapted by E. A. Martin. There were problems during production. William Selig, responsible for the day-to-day filming, accused Warner of inserting spies on the set, and of colluding with distributors to sell the film rights. The production thus dragged on for six months, during which time director E. A. Martin paid attention to the lead actress, with whom he had an affair. Martin's wife confronted him in the studio, and the actress had to stop filming abruptly, necessitating a lot of film ending.<br/><br/>The show was also marred by an incident in which during a scene with a lion, actor Ben Hagerty was injured, which resulted in him being hospitalized for over a month, until he recovered and returned to filming.
