            The deaths of Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon (Dutch pronunciation: [krɪs ˈkreːmərs] and [liˈzɑnə ˈfroːn]), two Dutch students, occurred after they disappeared on 1 April 2014, while hiking a trail called El Pianista in Panama. After an extensive search, portions of their bodies were found a few months later. Their cause of death could not be determined definitively; Dutch authorities working with forensic and search-rescue investigators initially thought it likely the students had accidentally fallen from a cliff after becoming lost. The circumstances and aftermath of their disappearance have resulted in much speculation about their final days.<br/><br/>Although many theories have been presented as to what happened to Kremers and Froon, no official cause of death has been ruled. Panamanian authorities came under fire for allegedly mishandling the disappearance and aftermath. Further investigation into the case in 2017 raised questions about the initial investigation, as well as a possible link to murders in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Kris Kremers (age 21) and Lisanne Froon (age 22) both grew up in Amersfoort, Province of Utrecht, in the Netherlands. Kremers was described as an open, creative, and responsible individual, while Froon was described as aspiring, optimistic, intelligent, and a passionate volleyball player. Kremers had just completed her studies in cultural social education, specializing in art education at the University of Utrecht.
