            Lipstick Jungle is an American comedy-drama television series created by DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler that aired on NBC from February 7, 2008, to January 9, 2009. The series was produced by NBC Universal Television Studio (now Universal Media Studios). The hour-long series was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Candace Bushnell, who also served as executive producer alongside showrunner/head writer Oliver Goldstick. The pilot was directed by Gary Winick.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>Lipstick Jungle is a dramedy following the professional and personal lives of three best friends, all of whom are top professionals in their respective careers.  Victory Ford (Lindsay Price) is a fashion designer, Nico Reilly (Kim Raver) is the editor-in-chief of Bonfire magazine, and Wendy Healy (Brooke Shields) is the former president of Parador Pictures, currently producing independently.  These three powerful women are always there to support one another and navigate the crazy, romantic, and sometimes scary world that is New York City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>The cast initially included Gina Gershon as Wendy Healy, Melissa George as Nico Reilly, Will Toale as Shane Healy, and Robert Buckley as Kirby Atwood, with Matthew Morrison, Scott Cohen, and Edward Herrmann also attached. The show underwent significant changes, though, with all the aforementioned cast being replaced and with executive producers DeAnn Heline and Eileen Heisler, writers Rand Ravich and Jill Gordon, and director Nigel Cole all fired. Melissa George had been personally cast by Bushnell, but left in early 2007 when she was offered the HBO series In Treatment (she was replaced by Kim Raver).
