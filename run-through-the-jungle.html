            "Run Through the Jungle" is a 1970 song by American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was released as a double A-side single with "Up Around the Bend" and on the album Cosmo's Factory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The song was written by Creedence's lead singer, guitarist and songwriter, John Fogerty. It was included on their 1970 album Cosmo's Factory, the group's fifth album.  The song's title and lyrics, as well as the year it was released (1970), have led many to assume that the song is about the Vietnam War.  The fact that previous Creedence Clearwater Revival songs such as "Fortunate Son" were protests of the Vietnam War added to this belief.<br/><br/>However, in a 2016 interview, Fogerty explained that the song is actually about the proliferation of guns in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The thing I wanted to talk about was gun control and the proliferation of guns... I remember reading around that time that there was one gun for every man, woman and child in America, which I found staggering. So somewhere in the song, I think I said, '200 million guns are loaded.' Not that anyone else has the answer, but I did not have the answer to the question; I just had the question.
