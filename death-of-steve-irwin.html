            On 4 September 2006, Australian zookeeper, conservationist, and television programmer Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray while filming in the Great Barrier Reef. The stingray's barb pierced his chest, penetrating his thoracic wall and heart, causing massive trauma.  He was at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, taking part in the production of an underwater documentary Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for Bindi the Jungle Girl, his daughter Bindi's television programme.<br/><br/>Irwin's death is the only fatality from a stingray captured on video, although it has not been released to the public, and is one of the few human deaths from stingrays. Production of the documentary was completed and was broadcast on the Discovery Channel four months after Irwin's death. The documentary was completed with footage shot in the weeks following the incident, but without including any mention of Irwin's death, aside from a tribute to Irwin at the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Circumstances ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>While swimming in chest-deep water, 44-year-old Steve Irwin approached a stingray, with an approximate span of two metres (6 ft 7 in), from the rear, in order to film it swimming away. While the stingray has been described by most sources as a short-tail stingray, others have suggested that it may have been an Australian bull ray. The stingray, possibly mistaking Irwin's shadow for a tiger shark, suddenly "propped on its front" and stabbed Irwin several times with its tail.
