            Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford (May 1, 1916 – August 30, 2006), known as Glenn Ford, was a Canadian-born American actor. He was most prominent during Hollywood's Golden Age as one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and had a career that lasted more than 50 years.<br/><br/>Ford often portrayed ordinary men in unusual circumstances. Although he starred in many genres of film, some of his most significant roles were in the film noirs Gilda (1946) and The Big Heat (1953), and the high school drama Blackboard Jungle (1955). However, it was for comedies or westerns that he received acting laurels, including three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, winning for Pocketful of Miracles (1961). He also played a supporting role as Superman's mild-mannered  alter-ego Clark Kent's adoptive farmer father, Jonathan Kent, in the first film of the franchise series Superman (1978).<br/><br/>Five of his films have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant: Gilda (1946), The Big Heat (1953), Blackboard Jungle (1955), 3:10 to Yuma (1957) and Superman (1978).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Gwyllyn Samuel Newton Ford was born on May 1, 1916, in Sainte-Christine-d'Auvergne, Quebec, Canada the son of Hannah Wood (née Mitchell) and Newton Ford, an engineer with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Through his father, Ford was a great-nephew of Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and was also related to America's eighth President Martin Van Buren (1782–1862, served 1837–1841). In 1922, when Ford was age six, the family emigrated southwest across the border into the United States,  first to Venice, California, and then to Santa Monica, west of Los Angeles; his father, Newton became a motorman on a tram / streetcar for the Venice Electric Tram Company, a job he held until he died at age 50 in 1940, when his son Glenn was age 24.
