A sequel, George of the Jungle 2, was released direct-to-video on October 21, 2003.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>While touring Burundi with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters, San Francisco heiress Ursula Stanhope encounters her spoiled fiancé Lyle van de Groot, who wishes to take her home and had hired two poachers, Max and Thor, to track her down. Kwame tells the group of the "White Ape", a local legend of a superhuman primate that lives on Ape Mountain and rules the jungle. The next day, Ursula refuses to go home until she sees any ape, so Lyle goes with her into the jungle to find them.
