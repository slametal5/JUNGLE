            Jetlag Productions was an American animation studio that specialized on developing several animated films based on popular fairy tales and public-domain literature, and original productions during the 1990s. The film were animated in Japan by KKC&amp;D Asia and Animaru Ya, among other South Korean companies. They were originally released directly to VHS through the GoodTimes Home Video distribution company.<br/><br/>With the introduction of DVD, the films were later distributed via a newer department of the same company, GoodTimes Home Entertainment. The movies in Jetlag's catalogue were dubbed into many different languages and distributed by international departments of the GoodTimes corporation. Since 2005, the Gaiam company has held the copyrights to Jetlag Productions' animated films following GoodTimes Entertainment's bankruptcy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Jetlag Productions started out as a small animation studio, assisting in the productions of series such as The New Adventures of He-Man and Heroes on Hot Wheels in 1990, and Conan the Adventurer in 1992, until it was approached by Joe, Ken, and Stan Cayre (known artistically as the Cayre Brothers) of GoodTimes Entertainment. The company then replaced Golden Films as GoodTimes's provider of budget animated productions, when the contract with Golden Film expired. <br/><br/>Under the name of their new establishment, the Cayre Brothers produced Children's Classics, a series of animated films that were very similar to those from Golden Films in style. Beginning their releases in 1994, Jetlag Productions produced a total of 17 different animated films, 13 adaptations of existing material, and four original features.
