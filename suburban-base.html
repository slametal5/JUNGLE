            Suburban Base Records is a British breakbeat hardcore, rave and jungle/drum and bass record label. It is based in Romford, Havering, England. It was established by Danny Donnelly and operated in the UK from 1990 to 1997 and in the United States from 1994 to 1997, however, started to release again in 2014.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Danny Donnelly opened a record store in his native Romford, Essex. Named Boogie Times, the store specialised in dance music as well as producing its own self-made white label records. Donnelly's first release was a track called "Hypersonic" which he made with André Jacobs, the owner of Essex-based D-Zone Records. These Boogie Times white labels were well received by customers, as well as DJs from the nearby capital London, which enhanced the store's reputation. In the wake of this success, Donnelly was able to fund a nascent label entitled Suburban Base.<br/><br/>The fledgling label's first release was Kromozone's "The Rush", released in April 1991. This was followed by six further releases later in the year from artists Austin, M&amp;M, Rachel Wallace, Run Tings, Phuture Assassins and QBass.
