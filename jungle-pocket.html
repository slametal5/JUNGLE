            Jungle Pocket (Japanese: ジャングルポケット, 7 May 1998 – 2 March 2021) was a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted from 2000 until 2002 he won five of his thirteen races and ¥704,258,000 in prize money. As a two-year-old he showed promising form by winning two races including the Grade III Sapporo Nisai Stakes in record time. In the following year he won the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) and defeated an international field to win the Japan Cup. His achievements saw him voted Japanese Champion 3-Year-Old Colt and Japanese Horse of the Year for 2001. After failing to win in 2002 he was retired to stud and has had considerable success as a breeding stallion.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Jungle Pocket was a bay horse standing 16 hands high with a narrow white blaze bred in Japan by Northern Farm. He was sired by the Irish-bred, Italian-trained Tony Bin who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1988 before being exported to stand as a breeding stallion in Japan. Tony Bin's other progeny included Air Groove (Yushun Himba, Tenno Sho), Lady Pastel (Yushun Himba), North Flight (Yasuda Kinen, Mile Championship), Telegnosis (NHK Mile Cup) and Sakura Chitose O (Tenno Sho). His dam Dance Charmer was an unraced daughter of Nureyev.
