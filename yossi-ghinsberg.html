            Yosseph "Yossi" Ghinsberg (Hebrew: יוסי גינסברג; born 5 April 1959) is an Israeli adventurer, author, entrepreneur, humanitarian, and motivational speaker, now based in Byron Bay, Australia. Ghinsberg is most known for his survival story in an uncharted part of the Bolivian Amazon jungle for three weeks in 1981. Ghinsberg's survival story was enacted in the 2017 psychological thriller Jungle, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Yossi Ghinsberg. Ghinsberg's story was also featured in the documentary series I Shouldn't Be Alive on Discovery Channel.<br/><br/>Ghinsberg is now a tech-entrepreneur and the founder of the mobile applications Headbox, which integrates all social media activity into one feed, and Blinq, which provides social media and activity live updates.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Amazon travel ==<br/><br/>After completing his service in the Israeli navy, Ghinsberg, inspired by the book Papillon by Henri Charrière, which detailed that author's experiences as an escaped convict, became determined to find Charrière and ask for his blessing to follow in his footsteps. Ghinsberg had briefly returned from an Africa to Mexico trip and longed for the rainforest immersion experience. He worked several jobs to save the money to travel to South America and dreamed of exploring the uninhabited heart of the Amazon jungle. By the time Ghinsberg was finally able to travel to South America, Charrière had passed away, and the tribes Ghinsberg was interested in "discovering" were already in contact with outsiders.<br/><br/>Ghinsberg hitchhiked from Venezuela to Colombia, where he met Markus Stamm, a teacher from Switzerland, in the midst of his expeditions, and the pair became good friends and traveled together to La Paz, Bolivia.
