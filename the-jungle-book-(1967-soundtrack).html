            The Jungle Book, the soundtrack to the Disney film The Jungle Book, has been released in three different versions. The film score was composed by George Bruns, with songs written by Terry Gilkyson and the Sherman Brothers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Composition ==<br/><br/>The instrumental music was written by George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney films, with the scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie using one of Bruns' themes for Sleeping Beauty, and Bagheera giving a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan being accompanied by Paul J. Smith's organ score from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.<br/><br/>"Overture" and "Jungle Beat" are scores separated from one deleted score "The Sand of Time" from The Sword in the Stone.<br/><br/>Longtime Disney collaborator Terry Gilkyson was brought in to write the songs for the film. Gilkyson delivered several complete songs which were faithful in tone to Rudyard Kipling's novel, but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark. The Sherman Brothers were brought in to do a complete rewrite, on the condition that they not read Kipling's book. The only piece of Gilkyson's work which survived to the final film was his upbeat tune "The Bare Necessities", which was liked by the rest of the film crew. In one of his first union jobs, famed songwriter Van Dyke Parks arranged the version of "Necessities" heard in the film.
