            The Rifle No. 5 Mk I, commonly referred to as the "jungle carbine" for its use in jungle warfare throughout Asia, was a bolt action carbine derivative of the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I. It was developed for jungle fighting experiences in the Pacific War that led the British to decide "a rifle shorter and lighter" than the regular Lee–Enfield was critical for better mobility. Produced between March 1944 and December 1947. It notably saw widespread usage on various sides of postwar colonial conflicts such as the Indonesian National Revolution, Malayan Emergency, and Vietnam War well into the 1960s, with sporadic use reported to have continued in several secessionist wars such as the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bougainville conflict throughout the rest of the 20th century.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>Experience of jungle fighting in 1943 identified that mobility was critical and to that end the weight of equipment carried by the individual soldier needed to be reduced. The requirement for a rifle was a "light handy weapon with good accuracy to 400 yards [370 m]"<br/><br/>The first tests of the rifles took place in 1944 during which a flash hider was added. The rifle was officially introduced into service in September 1944 with 20,000 produced, and by end of 1944, 50,000 had been accepted for service.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The No. 5 was about 100 mm (3.9 in) shorter and nearly a kilogram (2.2 lb) lighter than the No.
