            Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, also known as The Jungle Book, is a 1994 American adventure film co-written and directed by Stephen Sommers, produced by Edward S. Feldman and Raju Patel, from a story by Ronald Yanover and Mark Geldman. An independent production funded by MDP Worldwide, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Buena Vista Pictures in most territories in exchange for Disney providing half of the film's overall budget. The film is based on the Mowgli stories from The Jungle Book (1894) and The Second Jungle Book (1895) by Rudyard Kipling, but mostly focuses on the plotline of the second book. Unlike the books and Walt Disney's 1967 animated adaptation, the animal characters in this film do not talk.<br/><br/>The film stars Jason Scott Lee, Cary Elwes, Lena Headey, Sam Neill, and John Cleese. Released on December 25, 1994, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed $70 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>During the British rule in India, Mowgli is the five-year-old son of Nathoo, a widowed guide who is guiding an expedition in the jungle for fellow widower Colonel Geoffrey Brydon, his five-year-old daughter, Kitty, and Brydon's friend, Dr. Julius Plumford. Shere Khan the tiger begins stalking the group when fellow guide Buldeo and two other soldiers kill some animals for sport, which is against the jungle law. Shere Khan attacks the camp at night, killing the two soldiers and Nathoo, who dies trying to fight him off to defend Buldeo.
