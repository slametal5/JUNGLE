            Volcano is the fourth album by British electronic band Jungle, released on 11 August 2023 through Caiola Records and AWAL. It was preceded by the singles "Candle Flame", "Dominoes", "I've Been in Love" and "Back on 74". The album includes collaborations with Erick the Architect, Channel Tres, Roots Manuva, Mood Talk and Bas. The band simultaneously released a full-length film of the same name for members of their fan club. To support the album, they went on tour in Europe and North America throughout 2023 and Australia in 2024.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background and recording ==<br/><br/>The band wrote the album on the tour for their previous album, Loving in Stereo (2021), and began recording it in an Airbnb rental in Los Angeles before returning to Studio B of Metropolis Studios in London. Josh Lloyd called it "the most honest record [the band has] made", also saying: "We've always had this soul side and this love for soul music, so it's always been a little bit more song-based. The new record is just an extension of that journey". Lloyd also stated that Jungle's music is "now getting to this place where it sounds freer, and more off the cuff than it's ever done" and the "energy" on Volcano is "very quick and explosive and not so tame".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Critical reception ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Volcano received a score of 81 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on eight critics' reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Robin Murray of Clash stated that "at times, Jungle's soulful appeal is worth placing alongside Sault, and that's no mean feat", calling it a "focussed, unified return" that "doffs its cap to some supreme influences, while also allowing Jungle to expand, and evolve".
