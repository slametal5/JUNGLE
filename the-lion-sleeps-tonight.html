            "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" is a song originally written and first recorded in 1939 by Solomon Linda under the title "Mbube", through South African Gallo Record Company. In 1961, a version adapted into English by the doo-wop group the Tokens became a number-one hit in the United States. It earned millions in royalties from cover versions and film licensing.  Lyrics of Linda's original version were written in Zulu, while those from the Tokens' adaptation were written by George David Weiss.  <br/><br/>The song has been adapted and covered internationally by many pop and folk artists. It was first recorded in the United States by the Weavers in November 1951, and published under the title "Wimoweh" by a branch of Folkways Records in December of the same year.  The pop group Tight Fit made a cover of the song in 1982, reaching number one hit in the UK.  Other artists who have recorded various versions of the song include R.E.M., NSYNC, Henri Salvador, Karl Denver, Jimmy Dorsey, Yma Sumac, Noro Morales, Roy Zimmerman, Miriam Makeba, and The Kingston Trio.  The song is in the key of F major.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The original song title was "Mbube" (the Zulu word for "lion") and was written and first recorded in 1939 by Solomon Linda, a South African Zulu singer, who worked for the Gallo Record Company in Johannesburg as a cleaner and record packer. He spent his weekends performing with his musical ensemble, "The Evening Birds", and it was at this record label, under the direction of producer "Griffiths Motsieloa", that Linda and his fellow musicians recorded several songs, including "Mbube", which incorporated a call and response pattern common among many Sub-Saharan African ethnic groups, including the Zulu.
