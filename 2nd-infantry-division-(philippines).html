            The 2nd Infantry Division, Philippine Army nicknamed Jungle Fighter, is the Philippine Army's primary infantry unit specializing in jungle warfare.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2nd Regular Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army during World War II under the Japanese Invasion ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The 2nd Regular Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, was activated 6 January 1942, uniting the 4 existing Philippine Constabulary Regiments under one divisional command.  Part of these troops were at Camp Murphy (now Camp Emilio Aguinaldo) in Quezon City and part at Fort William McKinley (now Fort Andres Bonifacio) in Taguig, Rizal (now part of Metro Manila). The Armed Forces reorganization acts passed in 1936 led to the decision to militarize Constabulary (Police) officers into organized fighting units. The Constabulary reverted to their original semi-military ("gendarme") structure in 1938.  But the need for more armed Filipinos to aid in resisting the rise and possible threat of Japanese military operations in mid-1941 led to the re-establishment of formal military organization of the Constabulary forces.  Therefore, the organization of four regiments finally got underway in the early Fall of 1941, and upon activation, each regiment was inducted into the tables of organization and orders of battle for the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE).  The 1st Philippine Constabulary Regiment dates from 15 Oct 1941; the 2nd Regiment from 17 Nov 1941; the 3rd Regiment from 12 Dec 1941; and the 4th Regiment from 29 Dec 1941.<br/><br/>Most of the 1st Regiment and all of the 2nd had been guarding public utilities and other targets of potential sabotage in the Manila metro area.  By 31 Dec 1941, the 3rd and newly formed 4th Regiments were on Bataan, or were en route.
