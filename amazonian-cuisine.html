<h1>Amazonian cuisine</h1>
            
            Amazonian cuisine includes the foods and preparation methods of various peoples in the Amazon jungle of South America, including the dishes they have popularized among neighbors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Brazil ==<br/><br/>Maniçoba is an Amazonian dish from Brazil  made with pieces of meat, sausage, manioc, and culantro leaves. Amazonian cuisine includes many freshwater fish such as peixe nobre (noble fish), the pirarucu (the world's largest freshwater fish), and tambaqui. Smaller fishes such as surubim, curimatã, jaraqui, acari and tucunaré are also eaten, often grilled or sometimes fried. Served in a tomato sauce, the dishes are known as escabeche; they can also be prepared in coconut milk or stewed in tucupi (a sauce made with fermented manioc juices). Tacacá is a shrimp soup and vatapá is a Bahian seafood dish.<br/><br/>Staples of Amazonian cuisine include manioc, a starchy root vegetable, as well as fruit. Juices and ice creams are made from them, including acerola,  graviola, fruta de conde (also referred to as ata in Spanish and as sugar-apple in English), and cupuaçu. Açai is gaining widespread renown. There are also juices from palm trees such as taperebá, buriti and bacuri.
