            Arthur - The Dog Who Crossed the Jungle to Find a Home is a memoir written by Mikael Lindnord and Val Hudson in 2016. It is the true story of one man and a dog who found each other during an adventure race in Ecuador.<br/><br/>The book has been translated into multiple languages and has been adapted as the film Arthur the King by Lionsgate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>As Mikael Lindnord leads his Swedish adventure racing team on a challenging 435-mile journey through the jungles and mountains of South America, an unexpected companion joins them for the last stretch of the trip when Mikael shares a meatball with a scruffy yet dignified mongrel. The team find themselves unable to shake off their newfound canine friend, as this dog had been used to following foreigners on medical brigades and research expeditions. However, as Lindnord's team face rivers, illnesses, injuries, exhaustion and some of the toughest terrain on Earth, Mikael thinks he has formed a strong bond with the dog, now named Arthur.<br/><br/>Their shared odyssey, documented with candid photographs and narrated in compelling prose, serves as a powerful testament to the remarkable connection between dogs and humans. When the team reaches the finish line, Mikael decides to adopt Arthur and bring him back to his family in Sweden, demonstrating the enduring and extraordinary companionship that can develop between man and dog. Mikael never asked whose dog it was when he was in the region.<br/><br/>In November 2014, an Ecuadorian man told a local newspaper that Arthur was his dog, Barbuncho.
