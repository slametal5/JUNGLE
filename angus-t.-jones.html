            Angus Turner Jones (born October 8, 1993) is an American actor. After making his film debut in Simpatico (1999), he followed with a starring role in See Spot Run (2001) and supporting roles in The Rookie (2002) and Bringing Down the House (2003).<br/><br/>Jones gained mainstream recognition with his lead role as Jake Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003–2013), for which he won two Young Artist Awards and a TV Land Award.<br/><br/>In November 2012, Jones openly criticized Two and a Half Men, which led to his character being downgraded to a recurring status for the show's eleventh season. He officially left the show in March 2014, although he returned for its finale in February 2015.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Jones's first film role was as a five-year-old in the 1999 film Simpatico. From 2001 to 2003, he had supporting roles in films including See Spot Run, The Rookie, Bringing Down the House, George of the Jungle 2, and The Christmas Blessing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Two and a Half Men ===<br/><br/>In 2003, Jones was cast in the sitcom Two and a Half Men as Jake Harper, the "half man" of the title, a 10-year-old living with his divorced father (played by Jon Cryer) and hedonistic uncle (played by Charlie Sheen). The show was the most popular sitcom in the United States for most of its run, with an average audience of around 15 million people.<br/><br/>In 2010, Jones became the highest paid child star in television at the age of 17 when his new contract with Two and a Half Men guaranteed him US$7.8 million over the next two seasons, amounting to US$300,000 for each of the 26 episodes.
