Based on the Nick Jr. animated television series Dora the Explorer, the film was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on August 9, 2019, the same day the final then-unaired episode of Dora the Explorer aired there.<br/><br/>Produced by Paramount Players and Nickelodeon Movies in association with Walden Media, MRC and Burr! Productions, it is a loose live-action adaptation of the aforementioned series and the first such film in the eponymous media franchise as a whole created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh Valdes and Eric Weiner. It stars Isabela Moner, Eugenio Derbez, Michael Peña and Eva Longoria, with Danny Trejo as the voice of Boots. The titular Lost City of Gold is based on the legendary Inca city, Paititi.<br/><br/>A live-action Dora film was announced in 2017, and Moner was cast in the title role in May 2018.
